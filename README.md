## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/kuhuisien/xyz-feedback-portal
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd xyz-feedback-portal
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Running locally

1. Spin up a local development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
npm start
```

### Building

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

```bash
npm install
```

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Testing

Launch `jest`, our test runner in interactive watch mode.

```bash
npm test
```

Launch `jest`, with test coverage reporting. Your jest test coverage report will be generated at `./coverage`, and you can open the `index.html` webpage there to take a look at your coverage stats.

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
